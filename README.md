# GitHub Search

Github search app allows an authenticated Github user to search Github repositories and users, using their search parameters.  

On landing on the app, the user is greeted with a button that reads “Login to Github”. Once logged in, the user is then redirected to a search page, where they can search Github, for
repositories or users.  

On the search results page, the search results should be categorised into two sections - Repositories and Users. Repositories should be the default results when searching.
Search results are paginated, with 10 results per page.
